- Texture Manager initialises tile textures. A tile std::map is created that looks like this:
    ["ground.png", sf::IntRect({0,0}, {16,16})],
    ["brick.png", sf::IntRect({16,0}, {16,16})]
   It also creates an texture atlas with all the blocks
- Model Manager initialises model json files
- Looks at where its texture is in the map and gets the intrect
- After all models are initialised, the tiles point to the texture atlas with the intrect
