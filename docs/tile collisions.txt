currently collision boxes cover large sections of tiles
what if we need to do something that requires individual tile collision, or non at all?
e.g.:
    - player hitting a qblock from the bottom and a coin coming out?
    - background hill stuff

TileType::Air               --> no collision boxes created
TileType::Solid             --> big collision boxes created
TileType::ItemBlock         -->
TileType::BreakableBlock
