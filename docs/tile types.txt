tiles arent always just solid.
some can be walk through, others are animated, or interactable


define some TileType enum
enum TileType{
    Air,
    Solid,
    ItemBlock,
    BreakableBlock
}

Air             --> Passable.
Solid           --> Generic Solid.
ItemBlock       --> Contains item. Turns into a solid hard block when depleted.
BreakableBlock  --> Breaks on certain conditions, or just otherwise bounces.
