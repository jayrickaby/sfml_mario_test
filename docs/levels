Level data contains the "skin index" as each tile has a different usable skin
Index -1 = Use global skin
Index 0 = Overworld
Index 1 = Underground
Index 2 = Water
Index 3 = Castle

Based is on a grid of 16px.
Every tile = 16px,
Position at 0,0 = 0px, 0px on screen
Position at 1,0 = 16px, 0px on screen

Size allows reiteration of tile
Size of 16,0 => 16 of this tile rightward
